# Sensor Node On Steroids
#
#
# UPDATE: please read 
i could not get it right as a diy version with this many improvements this was my mean intestion but after 6 revisions i had to ditch the diy path.
had to many issues: a to high cost, hard to solder and temperature sensor had a very large drift from the board heating up.

### What?

so after running the Bruh Multisensors for 2 years it was time to upgrade!

This project is a relative easy way to get started with your own SNOS Multisensor with ESPhome firmware.

### Why?

I wanted a smaller and more smart sensor so i get to the drawing board.

### my wish list:

Motion sensor
Accurate temperature and humidity sensor
Light sensor (bh1750 or/both LDR )
Air quality sensor (aiq, tvoc, eCO2 )
Better led notification (brightness and colour saturation)
Sound notification
External temperature sensor (for monitoring entertainment closet, water temp, fridge,…)

now you probably going to say this cant be possibly smaller than the awesome Bruh Multisensor
but your wrong is roughly half the size!

i created a daughterboard that will fit this all
